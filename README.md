# SportIt
A sports event organisation
SportIT is a Sport Event Management Organization. Our system provides a unified platform for event hosts, teams, audiences and sponsors wherein they can plan, participate, buy tickets and promote the event. 
Organizers may not have all the resources at hand to host their event. SportIt helps them organize the event in a more efficient way and target larger audiences through its social share feature. 
Various local teams or sport players do not gain recognition because they do not get a big platform to showcase their performance; we provide them with opportunities to prove their worth; local sponsors would get to promote their brand at such events. A win-win for all.
